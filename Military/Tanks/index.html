          <p>
            The T-34 is a Soviet medium tank that had a profound and lasting effect on the field of tank design.
          </p>
          <p>
            The T-34 possessed an unprecedented combination of firepower, mobility, protection and ruggedness.
          </p>
          <p>
             Its 76.2 mm (3 in) high-velocity tank gun provided a substantial increase in firepower over any of its contemporaries, and its well-sloped armour was difficult to penetrate by most contemporary anti-tank weapons.
